Installation:

This control must be registered in order to work properly.  Please 
register the ezVidC60.ocx using regsvr32.exe before loading any
enclosed sample projects in order to avoid error messages during 
project load.

For your convenience I have included register.bat and unregister.bat
files in this archive.  The ocx can be registered on your machine
by simply double-clicking on the register.bat file.  *Note - the
ocx and bat file must be in the same directory and regsvr32.exe
must be located somewhere in your computer's path in order for this
method to work.

If all else fails, simply load the sample project, ignoring the 
warning messages, and select "components" from the "project" menu and
"browse" your hard disk until you locate the ocx.  Selecting it
once this way will register it on your system.

Enjoy!
