AutoDial - Telephone dialer demo program

This Visual Basic 5.0 example program demonstrates how an application
can dial a telephone number under Windows 95 using Assisted Telephony
which is a subset of TAPI. This code is simple because it relies on a
call manager applet to perform the actual dialing.

This program may be distributed on the condition that it is
distributed in full and unchanged, and that no fee is charged for
such distribution with the exception of reasonable shipping and media
charged. In addition, the code in this program may be incorporated
